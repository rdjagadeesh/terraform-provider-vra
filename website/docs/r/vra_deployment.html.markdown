# Resource: vra\_deployment

This resource provides a way to create a deployment in vRealize Automation(vRA) by either using a blueprint, or catalog item, or an inline blueprint.

## Example Usages

This is an example of how to create a deployment using a catalog item.

```hcl
resource "vra_deployment" "this" {
  name        = var.deployment_name
  description = "Deployment description"

  catalog_item_id      = var.catalog_item_id
  catalog_item_version = var.catalog_item_version
  project_id           = var.project_id

  inputs = {
    flavor = "small"
    image  = "centos"
    count  = 1
    flag   = false
    number = 10.0
    arrayProp = jsonencode(["foo", "bar", "where", "waldo"])
    objectProp = jsonencode({ "key1": "value1", "key2": [1, 2, 3, 4] })
  }

  timeouts {
    create = "30m"
    delete = "30m"
    update = "30m"
  }
}
```

This is an example of how to create a deployment using a cloud template.

```hcl
resource "vra_deployment" "this" {
  name        = var.deployment_name
  description = "Deployment description"

  blueprint_id      = var.blueprint_id
  blueprint_version = var.blueprint_version
  project_id        = var.project_id

  inputs = {
    flavor = "small"
    image  = "centos"
    count  = 1
    flag   = true
    arrayProp = jsonencode(["foo", "bar", "baz"])
    objectProp = jsonencode({ "key": "value", "key2": [1, 2, 3] })
  }

  timeouts {
    create = "30m"
    delete = "30m"
    update = "30m"
  }
}
```

This is an example of how to create a deployment without any resources so that it may be attached to other IaaS resoruces like `vra_machine`, `vra_network`, etc.

```hcl
resource "vra_deployment" "this" {
  name        = var.deployment_name
  description = "Deployment description"

  project_id = var.project_id
}
```
